# Python-Challenge

For my PyBank analysis, I used the class activities to help me structure lines 1-28 in my code. This helped me properly open and read the csv file, along with appending the data to variables which made it easier to set up the rest of my code.

After getting multiple string and integer errors, I had to learn how to convert the ['profit/losses'] data into a list of integers instead of strings. The website geeksforgeeks.org helped me understand how to make this conversion using list comprehension, this was used in line 31 of my code. By using list conversion, I was then able to find the sum of the profit/losses.

For lines 39-40, I knew I had to loop through the data in profit/losses, but didnt know how to exactly write the function. I used information from W3schools to help me. I also kept getting the error that the list was not in the range, so I found a solution that I had to write -1 since python reads from 0 first.

To find the average, i divded the sum by the length which we were tought in class, but I went back to the in-class activities for help with this.

The max and min functions I found on geeksforgeeks.org as well.
